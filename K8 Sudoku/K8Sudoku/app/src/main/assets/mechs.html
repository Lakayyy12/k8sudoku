<h1>Sudoku Instructions</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Start with a partially filled Sudoku grid: Begin with a 9x9 grid that already contains some
        numbers. These given numbers are clues to help you solve the puzzle.
    </li>
    <BR><BR>
    <li>Fill in the missing numbers: Look for empty cells in the grid, and based on the given
        numbers and the rules of Sudoku, determine the correct number to fill in each empty cell.
        Remember that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid should contain all the numbers from 1 to 9
        without repetition.
    </li>
    <BR><BR>
    <li>Use process of elimination: Analyze each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid to identify the
        possible numbers that can be placed in each empty cell. Eliminate numbers that are already
        present in the same row, column, or sub-grid to narrow down the options.
    </li>
    <BR><BR>
    <li>Apply the "sole candidate" rule: When a particular empty cell has only one possible number
        that can be placed based on the given numbers and the numbers already present in the row,
        column, and sub-grid, fill in that number.
    </li>
    <BR><BR>
    <li>Repeat and refine: Continue filling in numbers, using the given clues, the rules of Sudoku,
        and the process of elimination. Keep applying logical reasoning and refining your choices
        until the entire grid is filled.
    </li>
</ul>
